## Overview

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

1. clone repo
2. install package.json : `npm install` <!-- close -->
3. Create a `.env` file at the root of your project.
4. Copy and paste the following line(s) of code into the file you just created:

```bash
PORT=3001
````

<!-- this definitely also requires a DATABASE_URL in your .env file -->

5. install the following dependencies :

<!-- not required, npm i does this -->
````sh
npm install Auth0 axios dotenv cors express mongoose 
````

5. `npm start` to begin running the server

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

**Languages :** JavaScript | HTML | CSS | Markdown

**Libraries :**  Cors | dotenv | Express | Mongoose

**Tools :** Trello | Github | VS Code / Heroku


## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:
